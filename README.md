# miniRT
From scratch take on building a simple RayTracing engine.

![works pretty well](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wendrul/miniRT/master/img/4kbby.jpg)

## Pretty images

We tried going for scenes like this example:

![not our footage](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/618556901222907904/766714098649661440/unknown.png) `<- example`

And it turned out like this:

![Pog champ win](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/wendrul/miniRT/master/img/unknown%20(8).png) epic victory royale

And then `RTX ON`:

huh...

This sqaure is actually an Linf norm ball ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

## Trouble

Not everything was pretty in this journey towards realism. But sometimes getting results that could not be further away from reality, had a beauty you cannot find in the real world...

You are supposed to render the triangle, not everything else...

### using norm Linf instead of good ol L2

This is a sphere supposedly:

![not a sphere](https://github.com/wendrul/miniRT/blob/master/img/trouble/norm_inf0.jpg)

zoom out

![zoom no more](https://github.com/wendrul/miniRT/blob/master/img/trouble/norm_inf1.jpg)

zoomer out 

![zoom no morer](https://github.com/wendrul/miniRT/blob/master/img/trouble/norm_inf2.jpg)

There are no more available zoomers to code this.

jk this one is actually the [pillar scene](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/wendrul/miniRT/master/img/seven4k.jpg) lol.

### Refraction

This is not a feature present on this ratracer (yet) and for a reason

![see trhou](https://github.com/wendrul/miniRT/blob/master/img/trouble/unknown%20(1).png)

![oh no see why](https://github.com/wendrul/miniRT/blob/master/img/trouble/unknown%20(2).png)
